This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: David Stewart (daastewa@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Christopher Hahn (cnhahn@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming 
pair should drive roughly 50% of the time the pair
is working together, and at most 25% of an individual s
effort for an assignment should be spent working alone.
Any work done by a solitary programmer must be reviewed
by the partner. The object is to work together, 
learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different 
piece.

David Stewart spent 14 hours working alone.
Christopher Hahn spent 8 hours working alone.
We spent 8 hours working together.
David Stewart spent 5 hours driving.
Christopher Hahn spent 4 hours driving.
